# Random Notes

* When computing number of subsets, it's 2^N and should be using bitmask
* __builtin_popcount(unsigned int) in the GNU C++ compiler calculates the number of 1s in a binary number (Integer.bitCount(i, j) in Java)
* std::bitset is useful for bit related stuffs
* stoi() can specify a base in the 3rd parameter

## Segment Tree (Range Query)

It's effectively a binary tree!
